Problem Statement 1
Scenario: In many residential communities, residents often rely on outdated methods of
communication, such as paper notices on bulletin boards, emails, or word of mouth, to stay
informed about important updates. For instance, a neighborhood might need to notify residents
about a planned water shutoff, a scheduled community clean-up day, or an upcoming
neighborhood watch meeting. These traditional methods can result in missed information or
delayed updates, leading to confusion and frustration among residents. For example, if a
community event is announced via email but a resident doesn't check their inbox regularly, they
might miss the event entirely. This lack of effective communication can contribute to a sense of
disconnection and dissatisfaction within the community
